Dear $Assoociate$,
<BR>
<BR>
we have defined performance key result areas (KRA’s) of associates in alignment with the goals and targets for client delivery.
<BR>
<BR>
The KRAs focus driving high-performance, innovation, teaming, collaboration, competence development, and contribution to organization development by associates. Please find attached a letter containing the description of KRAs applicable to you for the year 2020-21.
<BR>
<BR>
We will be conducting KRA briefing meetings for implementation guidance. Please implement appropriate action plan for improving your work performance and competence. Your performance against the KRAs will be monitored by your Reporting Manager and reviewed periodically by the Associate Development Review Committee. 
<BR>
<BR>
HR department will be in touch with you and provide necessary guidance for your work performance and competency development planning, implementation, and development reviews.
<BR>
<BR>
All the best!!
